{"name":"Responsive Lightbox","tagline":"Lightweight, image only responsive, jQuery lightbox","body":"I am pleased to present my image-only, responsive, super lightweight, jQuery lightbox plugin.\r\n\r\nI was recently tasked with finding a lightbox plugin for high traffic ecommerce site I was building from scratch. Given the impact page weight can have on conversion, bounce rates and a bunch of other delicate analytic metrics, it was essential every piece of JavaScript selected for the site was as lightweight as possible, along with being responsive.\r\n\r\nMost lightboxes that met the responsive requirement came bundled with functionality to display videos, and transitioned from slide to slide in more elaborate ways than the next. I just wanted to popup an image so I built my own. \r\n\r\nOver time I've added a few options to keep make it a bit reusable but still it remains less than 1KB minified and GZipped.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/duncanmcdougall/Responsive-Lightbox/master/demo/images/sample_a.jpg\">\r\n   <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/duncanmcdougall/Responsive-Lightbox/master/demo/images/sample_a_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Venice\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nFirstly drop in jQuery 1.4 or above.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n   <head>\r\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lightbox.css\" />\r\n   </head>\r\n   <body>\r\n      <!-- Link to the image -->\r\n      <div class=\"gallery\">\r\n         <a href=\"photo1.jpg\">Image 1</a>\r\n         <a href=\"photo2.jpg\">Image 2</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n      <script src=\"lightbox.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n      <script>\r\n         $(function()\r\n         {\r\n            $('.gallery a').lightbox(); \r\n\r\n            // If you want seperate galleries on the same page\r\n            // just specify different class names. \r\n            $('.gallery-2 a').lightbox();\r\n         });\r\n      </script>\r\n   </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n* margin - int - default 50. Minimum margin around the image\r\n* nav - bool - default true. enable navigation\r\n* blur - bool - default true. Blur other content when open using css filter\r\n* minSize - int - default 0. Min window width or height to open lightbox. Below threshold will open image in a new tab.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('.gallery').lightbox({ margin: 20, nav: false, blur: true, minSize: 480 });\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
